a tiny tool to find and count files with a given extension

##### Usage: #####

---

This little thing is to show how many files of the given type (EXTENSION) are in the given directory with its subdirectories (PATH).
The result is displayed as directories sorted from the directory that contains the most of the files to the directory with the least number of files with the extension.

It also provides the total number of files and directories where the files were found.


Considering to add a posssibility to search for file of many types at the same time.
